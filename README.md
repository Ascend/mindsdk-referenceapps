# MindSDK Reference Apps

[MindSDK](https://www.hiascend.com/software/mindx-sdk) is a software development kit (SDK) launched by Huawei, offering simple and easy-to-use, high-performance APIs and tools. It includes multiple SDKs such as Vision SDK (visual analysis), Index SDK (feature retrieval), and Rec SDK (search recommendation), aiding the Ascend AI processor in empowering various application scenarios.

To help developers quickly master the use of Vision SDK and Index SDK interfaces and rapidly implement business functions, this code repository provides various reference samples developed based on Vision SDK and Index SDK. The Agent SDK provides interfaces to build agent application. Users can select the appropriate sample code according to their needs.
