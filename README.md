# Mind SDK Reference Apps

[Mind SDK](https://www.hiascend.com/software/mindx-sdk) is a software development kit (SDK) launched by Huawei, offering simple and easy-to-use, high-performance APIs and tools. It includes multiple SDKs such as mxVision (visual analysis), mxRAG (knowledge enhancement), mxIndex (feature retrieval), and mxRec (search recommendation), aiding the Ascend AI processor in empowering various application scenarios.

To help developers quickly master the use of mxVision, mxRAG and mxIndex interfaces and rapidly implement business functions, this code repository (mxSdkReferenceApps) provides various reference samples developed based on mxVision, mxRAG and mxIndex. Users can select the appropriate sample code according to their needs.
